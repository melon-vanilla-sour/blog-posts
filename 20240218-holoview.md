Holoview was one of my first web apps I made that wasn't a result of following a tutorial and something I personally wanted to use as a service. It was a simple SPA that consumed an API to present Hololive live streams that were currently airing/going to air. Unfortunately the entire app relied on convertly using a fan-made API I randomly found on the internet and when that shutdown, so too did the functionality of Holoview. Ah well, it was a good learning experience and pretty neat while it lasted.
