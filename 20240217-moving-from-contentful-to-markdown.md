In the previous update for my blog, I converted the input format of posts from rich text to markdown. However I still used Contentful as a CMS

The editing workflow is much better now. I have all the usual tools in VSCode to create and edit my posts and when I'm done I simply push them to the repository which triggers a new build to start.
