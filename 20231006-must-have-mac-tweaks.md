My main desktops are all Windows (for gaming) but I use a Mac for dev work. However there were some tweaks I had to make to fix some pain points with the system. Here are 3 programs I pretty much consider essential when working on Mac OS.

## Maccy

A free open source clipboard manager for Mac OS. At work I often need to paste links in chat, titles across tickets, variables within code and so on. Having access to the clipboard history is a godsend since Mac doesn't track it by default. It feature fuzzy search and is as valuable as the browser/command history when trying to find that one page or command you vaguely remember from weeks ago.

## UnnaturalScrollWheels

The first thing I noticed when connecting my mouse to a Mac was the disgusting mouse acceleration that couldn't be turned off in the settings. UnnaturalScrollWheels is a free open source mouse utility software that has a side feature to disable mouse acceleration. As the name suggests, the main feature of the program is to reverse the default scroll direction of Mac since it's the opposite of Windows.

## Autoclick

I was looking for a program or script that reliably kept my Slack status green but most were either not free or only prevented sleep without simulating an activate state. Autoclick is an open source program that just works, though it was pretty hidden since the name doesn't do any favors with SEO. The project has been archived since October 2022 but works for me as of October 2023. Just be sure to activate it whilst the mouse is over the Slack App.
