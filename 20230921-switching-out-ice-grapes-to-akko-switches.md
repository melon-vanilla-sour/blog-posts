## some heading

In a previous post about building my mechanical keyboard, I mentioned using Tecsee Ice Grapes for my switches.
They're made with a material called UHMWPE, which supposedly breaks down to form a natural lubrication as you continuously use the switch. Coupled with the fact that I painstakingly lubed around all 80 of them, I was fairly satisfied with the smooth experience, at first. The thing is, these switches have an actuation force of 52g so they're slightly on the heavier side when compared to the standard 45g of say Gateron reds. I mentioned how the slight pressure felt good when I first started using them but I tend to type a lot, and the weight eventually felt tiring during long sessions.

I think this is a serious point of consideration when trying out switches or keyboards in stores. Tactile switches feel unique and interesting at first but the feeling might wear off when going through a large essay. A light linear is 'boring' but very functional.

So given this slight issue I started researching for lighter switches and arrived at the Akko brand, particularly the Akko Cream blues and Akko Sakura. The former is a tactile switch with an actuation force of 38g and a tactile force of 53g. The Akko Sakuras are a linear switch with an actuation force of 39g. Both much lighter than average.
