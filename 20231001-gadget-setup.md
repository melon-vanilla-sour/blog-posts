Current setup as of October 2023.

## Monitor

HP model:5ZU98AA-AAAI

- 1080p
- 144hz
- TN
- 23.8inches


I got this mainly for the 144hz refresh rate that was at an affordable price point (22,880yen). TN panels have a slightly better pixel response time compared to IPS, but in return have lower contrast and color quality. At one point during work I left out some css because I literally could not see a very subtle light gray area in the mock up. It's totally unnoticeable in daily usage though.

For gaming, input lag is the most important number but it's often not explicitely stated in the specs. I read that recent IPS monitors also have competitive input lag values so I'm considering an IPS panel at 1440p as the next logical upgrade. (Currently eyeing the Dell S2721DGF)

## Mouse


Razer DeathAdder v2. This is actually my second DeathAdder after the first one I got more than a decade ago. I often read about Razer products having a high defect rate but that personally wasn't my experience at all, my first one only got a bit mushy with its left click after around 6-7 years of daily usage.

In terms of shape, it has an ergonomic contour and is slightly on the larger side which fits my hand perfectly. The design is also pretty minimalistic compared to the 'gaming mice' out there which generally look too busy for my liking. The two side buttons are convenient for back and forth navigation both in the browser and IDE.

## GPU

3060ti that came in a prebuilt desktop. I actually built my first two desktops but the tech tax in Japan coupled with the high cost of 3000 and now 4000 series GPUs meant that self-building isn't as cost effective compared to the past. It's more than enough to run games on high at 1080p (and maybe 1440p when I get that monitor) so I don't see myself upgrading this in the near future. As a bonus it has decent rendering times in Blender and encoding videos.

## Keyboard

Epomaker 84 with Akko Sakura and Cream Blue switches.
I've written some posts regarding the modding process in the past. Whilst the individual prices of the raw parts are very affordable, the amount I've spent trying out various switches and keycaps, alongside time spent modding (like lubing, especially lubing) is too damn high.

## Earphones

Good ol' trusty apple earbuds. I really dislike the canal type earphones that seem to have taken over the market in the past decade, they feel like I'm permanently wearing earplugs. If there's some sort of mid-range upgrade to earbuds I might consider those.

## Shoutout: HDMI and USB switcher

These things have the highest unexpected utility out of everything listed here. My current monitor has two ports (one hdmi, one dp) and I use it for my personal pc, my work pc and playstation. This means I had to manually reconnect the hdmi port when gaming on a console and reconnect the usbs when switching between pcs. Not only was this incredibly troublesome but apparently it causes wear on the ports as well. These switchers literally solve the issue with one button.
